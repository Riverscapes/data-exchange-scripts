"""
Upload multiple new projects from subfolders within a specified parent folder.
Each subfolder is expected to contain a project.rs.xml file and any associated data files.

Edit the launch.json file to set the path of the parent folder, as well as specify the owner and visibility for the new projects.
After you initiate the script you will be prompted to confirm before proceeding with the upload.

********** WARNING **********
This script can create a real mess if you use it unwisely. Pause and think before you run it.
You are advise to try it against the STAGING server first to make sure it does what you want.
