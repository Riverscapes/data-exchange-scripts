# Riverscapes-Athena AWS Bucket Organization

> ![Note] 2026-01-15 This file in `data-exchange-scripts` repository `\pipelines\athena_readme.md`

Pipelines output for Athena should go in the Riverscapes-athena bucket in the data_exchange/ prefix.  

Suggested naming convention, partitions & organization:

* folder for project type (machine name), assuming all data from the same type

## Contents 2026-01-15

It's kind of a mess:

* `2025conus-projects` - a "materialized view" so-to-speak, generated by a glue script daily, of project derived from other data in data_exchange folder
* project_types - a single handmade file used for tracking the waterfall of models in CONUS2025 RUNS
* projects - populated by dynamodb sync, I think
* riverscape_metrics - Oct 12 2025 scrape using `rme_to_athena\rme_to_athena_parquet.py` supplemented with more recent incremental update
* rs_metric_engine2 - Jan 15 enhancement of the riverscape_metrics parquet files with simplified geometry using `add_simplified_geom_pq.py`
* rs-context 
* rsdynamics-metrics/
* rsdynamics/ - maybe we should have grouped them 
* table_column_defs -- old version, deprecated & to be removed soon
* table_column_defs_v2 -- ditto
* test-double-geom -- testing if can have 2 geometries in one parquet file (A: yes). to be removed
